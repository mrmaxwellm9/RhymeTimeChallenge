<!--
Goals:
1: A timed mode where players can choose 30 seconds, 1 minute,  or a custom amount of time for a rhyme chain.
2: A normal difficulty option that starts the chain with a common English word with many words that rhyme. A challenge mode that can be any word. A daily mode that is a 1-minute normal mode question where all users get the same starting word.
5: If there are no more available rhymes, inform the player.
7: when the user guesses an incorrect rhyme, there should be a beep-beep buzzer sound, the textbox should shake, and the textbox border should be red until the textbox is edited again.

<!--
Other Goals:
1. If A rhymes with B then B rhymes with A, so using this idea I can lower the space used for the rhyme dictionary by only 
including unique words once by having sets of words that rhyme. Also, the part that needs to be quick is after the 
start word is chosen so it's fine if the loading before then is not that fast.
2. Fix how the words are parsed because you're and other words with ' are stored as "youre".
